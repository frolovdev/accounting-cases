(1) On April 1st, 2012, Girard decided to invest $200,000 and Park put up $50,000 To purchase a total of 25,000 shares in the new company. The par value of the shares was $1.


(2) Lacking the funds for her initial investment, Park borrowed the $50,000 from the Imperial Bank of Philadelphia on April 1, using her parent's house as collateral.


(3) On April 2nd, Park hired a lawyer to have the business incorporated. Because this was a fairly simple organization, the legal fees were only $3,900.

(4) To house the business, Park bought an abandoned pizza parlor near Fairmont Park for $155,000 on April 7. The building was old and needed renovation work. The purchase documents allocated $103,000 to land, and $52,000 to the building. Park paid for the building with $31,000 cash, and a $124,000 mortgage from the Imperial Bank.

(5) Park felt that some renovation work would extend the life of the building to 25 years with an expected salvage value of $10,000. She ordered the renovation work, costing $33,000, to begin immediately. The work was completed on May 25, at which time she paid in cash the amount owed for the renovations.

(6) Park phoned a number of metal detector vendors until she found one that was willing to give her volume discount. On June 2nd, Park purchased 240 metal detectors at an average cost of $500 per unit, so that's $120,000 total. The innovation in the industry is so rapid, that Park felt the units would only last for two years, at which time they would have no remaining value.

(7) On June 15th, Park ordered $2,000 to sundries inventory, for instance, water bottles, energy bars, etc., to be delivered on June 30th. Park was able to purchase the inventory on account, which meant she had up to 30 days after delivery to pay the supplier.

(8) on June 30th, Park paid $2,100 for a three-year site license to use geo-contour mapping software in the metal detectors.

(9) on June 30th, Park signed a contract with a local advertising agency to provide various forms of advertising for a period of one year. She paid $8.000 upfront for advertising through June 30th, 2013. 

(10) On June 30th, Park needed cash to make a payment on the Imperial Bank loan that funded her purchase of Relic Spotter stock. She borrowed $5,000 from Relic Spotter at 10% interest, with the principal and interest due in a lump sum on June 30th, 2013

(11)  On June 30th, Park also hired two employees, Linda Carlyle and Charlotte Cafferly to run the shop. They signed employment contracts promising each salaries of 32,000 per year.

(12) On June 30th Girard called from St. Tropez to check in on the business. Upon hearing that Relic Spotter only had $47,000 of cash left in the bank, Girard became concerned about his investment.

Thinking fast, Park stated she was so confident of Relic Spotter's prospects that she was declaring a $0.10 per share dividend, to be paid on August 31. So that's $25,000. This dividend seemed to reassure Girard.
